        description: "Thrombin is a serine protease belonging to the MEROPS protease family S1 (chymotrypsin family, PA(S) clan), subfamily S1A. Thrombin, also known as fibrinogenase and factor IIa, is the final protease in the vertebrate blood coagulation cascade. Thrombin triggers coagulation by releasing fibrinopeptides A and B from the amino termini of the fibrinogen a and b chains. This aptamer was selected through SELEX technology and exhibits high affinity and specific binding capability to human α-thrombin."
